 * Omitting lifetime annotations is referred to as *elision*, from the English

 * Examples:
 *   - "I *removed* the lifetime annotations" -> "I *elided" the lifeline
 * annotations";
 *   - "We can *remove* the annotations" -> "We can *elide* the annotations";
 *   - "Think about *removal* of the annotations" -> "Think about *elision* of
